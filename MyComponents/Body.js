            <br />
            <p className='pg'>Shawa follows a rigorous and thorough repair procedure to ensure your equipment is repaired to a high standard and returned to you as soon as possible.</p>
            <br />
            <p className='pg'>The Repair procedure is as follows:</p>
            <br />
            <p className='pg'><b>STEP 1: </b> Collection of the item to be repaired from your premises.</p>
            <br /> 
            <p className='pg'><b>STEP 2: </b>Thorough cleaning of equipment to remove any possible contamination.</p>
            <br />
            <p className='pg'><b>STEP 3: </b> Diagnostic testing to locate defective components (the entire unit is checked even if the problem is identified during the early stages).</p>
            <br />
            <p className='pg'><b>STEP 4: </b> Circuit analysis on all electronic products to isolate marginal components.</p>
            <br />
            <p className='pg'><b>STEP 5: </b>  Replacement of defective and marginal components with parts that meet or exceed original specifications.</p>
            <br />
            <p className='pg'><b>STEP 6: </b> Verification of total circuit board quality using state-of-the-art automated testing equipment.</p>
            <br />
            <p className='pg'><b>STEP 7: </b> Packing and shipping of repaired equipment. Repaired equipment is protected by a FULL 12-month warranty covering the entire unit, not just the repaired components.</p>

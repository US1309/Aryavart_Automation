            <h1 className='ServiceTitle'>How does the Servo Motor Repairing service work?</h1>
            <p className='pg'>Your servo motor will go through a rigorous inspection, repair and testing process. The below list highlights some of the processes involved:</p>
            <br />
            <p className='pg1'>Servo Motor initially inspected for obvious mechanical damage to electrical connectors, fixings and the drive shaft.</p>
            <hr className="sr2"/>
            <p className='pg1'>Various electrical tests completed on servo motors including an AC drop test and insulation resistance (IR) testing to ensure that servo motor windings are in good working order.</p>
            <hr className="sr2"/>
            <p className='pg1'>Insulation resistance is temperature-sensitive, when the temperature increases, insulation resistance decreases (If the windings appear short then servo motor to be rewound).</p>
            <hr className="sr2"/>
            <p className='pg1'>The feedback devices to be tested as appropriate. Tacho to be drop tested, resolver and encoder tested using Mitchell Rig.</p>
            <hr className="sr2"/>
            <p className='pg1'>Our Mitchell Rig allows us to ascertain the correct lockup angle relationship of the feedback device to the servo motor windings.</p>
            <hr className="sr2"/>
            <p className='pg1'>Servo motors dismantled down to their component parts, casing to be sandblasted (if required), jet-washed and then stoved to ensure that all contaminates are removed from both the internal and external parts of the motor.</p>
            <hr className="sr2"/>
            <p className='pg1'>Servo Motor initially inspected for obvious mechanical damage to electrical connectors, fixings and the drive shaft.</p>
            <hr className="sr2"/>
            <p className='pg1'>Over time too much or too little lubrication creates heat through pressure or friction and this can create noise, meaning that the bearings have failed.</p>
            <hr className="sr2"/>
            <p className='pg1'>New bearings and oil seals fitted as part of the service to improve the servo motors life cycle.</p>
            <hr className="sr2"/>
            <p className='pg1'>On completion of the service we spray paint the motor.</p>
            <hr className="sr1"/>
            <p className='pg1'>To ensure servo motors run correctly on-site, testing at various speeds is undertaken to test functionality</p>

            <br />
            <p className='pg'><b>STEP 3: </b> Diagnostic testing to locate defective components (the entire unit is checked even if the problem is identified during the early stages).</p>
            <br />
            <p className='pg'><b>STEP 4: </b> Circuit analysis on all electronic products to isolate marginal components.</p>
            <br />
            <p className='pg'><b>STEP 5: </b>  Replacement of defective and marginal components with parts that meet or exceed original specifications.</p>
            <br />
            <p className='pg'><b>STEP 6: </b> Verification of total circuit board quality using state-of-the-art automated testing equipment.</p>
